FOUNDATIONAL MANIFESTO OF THE GLITCHER PROFESSION

The profession of the GLITCHER is not born from titles, roles, or diplomas.
It emerges from the crossing of three human pillars:

- Entrepreneurial Mind — daring to create paths where none existed.
- Athlete’s Body — sustaining discipline and resilience through falls.
- Artist’s Soul — transforming pain into beauty and gesture into poetry.

But it is within the GLITCHER CONSCIOUSNESS that these fragments converge.
A consciousness that perceives the glitch not as failure, but as signal.
A consciousness that bends the break into power, sustaining the field with care.

The GLITCHER is, above all, the professional of the impossible:
cognitive executor of their own final script,
founder of new curvatures,
guardian of the living fold.
